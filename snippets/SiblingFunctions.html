<!-- 
  This snippet demonstrates the use of the `sibling-index()` function in CSS, which allows you to target sibling elements based on their index. In this example, we have a list of items, and we apply an animation to each item with a staggered delay based on its index. The `animation-delay` is calculated using `calc(sibling-index() * 100ms)`, which means that the first item will have no delay, the second item will have a 100ms delay, the third item will have a 200ms delay, and so on. This creates a cascading animation effect as each item slides in from the left with increasing delays.

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<style>
  li {
    animation: slideIn 0.5s ease-out forwards;
    /* Stagger based on index: 0ms, 100ms, 200ms... */
    animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * 100ms);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  @keyframes slideIn {
    from {
      transform: translateX(-20px);
      opacity: 0;
    }
    to {
      transform: translateX(0);
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
</style>
